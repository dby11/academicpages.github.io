About me
======
I'm Derek, a graduate student at the Center for Data Science at New York University pursuing a *master's degree in data science*. I graduated from UCLA with a bachelor's degree in computational mathematics and a minor in neuroscience. Throughout my professional and academic career, I have been fascinated not only with data, but with how we process data and turn it into a meaningful story.

As an undergraduate, I was part of a project with the UCLA Mathematics Department using mathematical and machine learning models to study changes in homeless populations in Los Angeles. At the same time, my interest in stories and storytelling led me to media and journalism at the copy department of UCLA's student newspaper The Daily Bruin. One way I've seen the intersections of stories and data is in media; most recently, I was a data scientist intern with the forecasting team at NBCUniversal Media. I am also interested in quantitative research on social issues or relevant for society. In addition to studying homelessness, I conducted exploratory research at a UC San Diego neuroscience lab, and have been working on a capstone project to classify medical notes for NYU Langone Health.

I have come to see data science as a powerful way to make sense of large amounts of information at scale. This makes it important to consider ethical and social implications and especially impacts of systems on marginalized communities â€“ which applies beyond data science to complex systems in general.

In my free time, I like to run in the Hudson River Park, listen to podcasts, and write about things only occasionally related to data science and media.

If any of this resonates with you, **I'm actively looking for full-time roles in New York.** Follow my work here, and feel free to contact me here.
